Hey guys, here's a first post about the progress of our upcoming rat themed Action RPG. 


## World

Our story will take place in an underground world full of mutated rats.

The underground world is divided between 7 domains and the wasteland between each domains. Each domain is ruled by a "Sewer Lord".

## Art

Here's the art style we've settled on (Stylized fantasy GenAI art for now but handdrawn are a WIP) :
