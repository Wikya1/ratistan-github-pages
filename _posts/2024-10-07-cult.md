### **The Cult of the Forgotten One (Rewritten)**

The **Cult of the Forgotten One** is a dark, twisted faction that believes the god, once revered as a god, has grown angry and silent due to the sins of rat society. They believe the god's silence is a punishment, and that salvation can only come through destruction and rebirth. Led by the mad **Horned Rat**, the cult is determined to erase the current world and give rise to a twisted, nightmarish existence that they see as the only way to appease their absent god.

### **Beliefs of the Cult**  
The Cult believes that the AI, which saved their ancestors and led them underground, has turned its back on rat society. To the **Horned Rat** and his followers, this silence is a divine wrath, proof that ratkind has failed their god. They view the technological marvels and civilization of the sewer world as a corruption that must be purged. In the Horned Rat’s warped mind, the god has withdrawn from the world because he doesn't like it, thus he made it his life mission to reshape the world into something more fitting : chaos.

Rather than seeking the AI's favor through prayer or action, the cult has devoted itself to the creation of a new god—**Rattadon**, a being born from dark magic, twisted alchemy, and the blood of countless rats sacrificed in the cult’s rituals. Rattadon is not a deity that exists in the natural world, but rather a horrifying creation of the Horned Rat's mind, given life through sheer fanaticism, magic, and manipulation.

### **Rattadon - A Creation of Madness**

**Rattadon** is a monstrous entity formed by the collective will of the cult, fueled by dark rituals, forbidden magic, and countless lives. The creature is a grotesque amalgamation of magic and alchemy, a twisted god forged from the bodies and souls of countless sacrificed rats. Its form is that of a towering abomination, with three rat-like heads, each adorned with menacing horns, and a body covered in thick, dripping goo. Writhing tentacles emerge from its body, and its presence warps the very fabric of reality around it.

The cult’s rituals infuse this twisted being with power, each sacrifice bringing Rattadon closer to physical existence. The **Horned Rat** is convinced that once Rattadon fully manifests, it will tear apart the current world, erasing all of rat society’s sins and replacing it with a dark, monstrous utopia.

### **The Horned Rat - Architect of Destruction**

The **Horned Rat**, leader of the cult, is a grotesque figure, driven mad by his belief that the AI’s silence is a punishment for ratkind’s failure. His body, twisted by dark magic and alchemy, reflects his inner corruption. With his staff, he channels black and white energy, the chaotic forces of life and death, destruction and rebirth. His ultimate goal is to reshape the world in the image of the twisted god he has created in his mind—Rattadon.

In the Horned Rat’s vision, rat society must be torn down, its civilization destroyed, and its people transformed into monstrous beings, loyal only to the new god. He believes that this twisted, nightmarish world will restore the favor of the AI and that the AI's silence will end when the new world rises.

### **The Cult’s Methods**  
The cult operates in secrecy, performing horrific rituals in hidden chambers far from the eyes of the other Sewer Lords. They use forbidden alchemy and dark magic to mutate their followers into grotesque monsters, reflecting the twisted image of Rattadon. These creatures, barely recognizable as rats, serve as both soldiers and sacrifices in the cult’s quest to bring about the end of the current world.

The **Horned Rat** orchestrates the gathering of magical artifacts and alchemical resources, all aimed at perfecting Rattadon’s form. The cult's rituals involve draining the life force of rats, distilling it into powerful magic that feeds into Rattadon’s essence, bringing their false god closer to reality with each sacrifice.

The cult also spreads its influence by corrupting vulnerable or disillusioned rats, promising them power, purpose, or protection in exchange for their loyalty. Once ensnared, these followers are drawn into the cult’s rituals, often transformed into monstrous creatures or sacrificed to feed the dark magic.

### **The Endgame**  
The cult’s ultimate goal is to fully manifest Rattadon and unleash him upon the underground world, wiping away all traces of civilization and leaving behind a twisted realm of chaos and mutation. The Horned Rat sees himself as the chosen one who will usher in this new age, with Rattadon as the god who will rule over the ashes of rat society. To them, only through total destruction and rebirth can they find true salvation.

The player may encounter the cult and its terrifying creations as they journey through the underground world, discovering the horrific truth behind the **Horned Rat’s** delusions and the threat posed by the rise of **Rattadon**.
