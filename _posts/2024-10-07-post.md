### Backstory

In a post-apocalyptic future, the world as we know it has been decimated by nuclear war, leaving the surface uninhabitable. As humanity neared extinction, a brilliant yet mad scientist created a superintelligent AI and entrusted it with an unusual task—protect seven enhanced lab rats and ensure their survival. The AI, driven by its programming, gathered the surviving rats of the world and sealed them in a massive underground complex modeled after the sewers of human cities. Over time, the rats evolved into a highly intelligent, organized society, split into different factions led by the descendants of the original seven lab rats, now called **Sewer Lords**.

These Sewer Lords rule distinct domains within the underground world, each reflecting their unique philosophies, abilities, and personalities. The society beneath the surface has grown complex over the centuries, thriving in the deep, forgotten corners of a shattered Earth, but tensions among the Sewer Lords and a lingering mystery surrounding the "God" to threaten to disrupt this fragile order.

As a simple rat hero emerges to explore the world and uncover its secrets, the fate of the underground society hangs in the balance.
